sudo systemctl start mongod

If you receive an error similar to the following when starting mongod:
Failed to start mongod.service: Unit mongod.service not found.
Run the following command first:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Then run the start command above again.

sudo systemctl status mongod

sudo systemctl stop mongod

sudo systemctl restart mongod

You can follow the state of the process for errors or important messages by watching the output in the /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log file.

Begin using MongoDB.
Start a mongosh session on the same host machine as the mongod. You can run mongosh without any command-line options to connect to a mongod that is running on your localhost with default port 27017.

For more information on connecting using mongosh, such as to connect to a mongod instance running on a different host and/or port, see the 
mongosh documentation.

To help you start using MongoDB, MongoDB provides Getting Started Guides in various driver editions. For the driver documentation, see
